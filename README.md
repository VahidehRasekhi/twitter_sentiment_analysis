## Project Title 
Sentiment Analysis of COVID and Vaccination Tweets


## Description
Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, programming languages, and statistics to systematically extract, identify,  quantify, and study people’s attitudes and opinions towards a topic.

In this project, I analyze Covid and vaccination tweets to determine whether people have positive or negative sentiment about this new virus and being vaccinated. I assume that there is a direct correlation between tweets that are considered as having positive sentiment and being willing to receive vaccination. 


## Motivation
Covid has caused a significant worldwide public health crisis, mental health crisis, economic crisis, job cuts, and unemployment. Since there is no cure yet and vaccination is the only way to slow the spread of the virus, people’s sentiments and opinions play a significant role in achieving herd immunity and controlling the spread of the virus.Given that during the pandemic, people have expressed their opinions and feelings via twitter, determining people’s emotional tone behind the words they used in their tweets provides us with an opportunity to gain an understanding of their attitudes and sentiment. Analyzing people’s sentiment is important because their emotions have an impact on their decision to comply with the CDC guidelines to receive covid vaccine and wear a mask.


## Questions 
*	What are people’s attitude towards Covid and vaccination? Do they  have mostly positive or negative feelings?
*	Are there any emotional trends that can be clustered based on geographical regions?
*	What words do people mostly use to express their feelings and opinions?
