# Sentiment Analysis of COVID and Vaccination 


Executive Summary
•	I plan to conduct sentiment analysis (i.e. people’s attitudes, emotions, and opinions) on Covid and vaccine, using twitter data. Covid has caused a significant worldwide public health crisis, mental health crisis, economic crisis, job cuts, and unemployment. During the pandemic, people have expressed their opinions and emotions via twitter. 
•	I also plan to find out if people from certain regions share certain attitudes towards covid/vaccine. If there are such trends, I can illustrate them on a map. 
•	I am also interested in finding out what words people have used more to express their emotions and opinions. I plan to create a word cloud depicting the frequent words people have used to express their emotions. 

Motivation
Covid has recently been one of the greatest threats against human beings. Since there is no cure yet and vaccination is the only way to slow the spread of the virus, people’s sentiments and opinions play a significant role in achieving herd immunity and controlling the spread of the virus. People’s tweets regarding their reactions to Covid/vaccine can have an impact on other people, and might persuade them to be against or in favor of vaccine. I think such studies can provide CDC and similar offices with information about people’s reactions and opinions. These offices (in collaboration with twitter and other social media) can prevent dissemination of misinformation and implement an effective vaccination promotion plan.
 
Data Question
•	What are people’s attitude towards Covid and vaccine? Do they  have mostly positive, negative, or neutral feelings?
•	Are there any emotional trends that can be clustered based on geographical regions?
•	What words do people mostly use to express their emotions?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
•	I will include charts to indicate what percentage of people have positive/negative/neutral feelings towards Covid and getting vaccinated.
•	I will have a map illustrating in which regions people have more positive or negative attitudes the covid and vaccine.
•	I will also have word clouds (representing positive/negative/neutral emotions) to show what words have been mostly used.
